### Day 15
    - Watched videos about Logistic Regression, cost function and gradient descent (revising the basics) of deep learning.
    - Trying to make the OpenAI GPT2 train
    - Still trying to wrap my head around GAN (understood a little bit the principal but still trying to understand the code)
### Day 16
    - Working on EDA for NLP (1)
    - Still trying to understand the GAN through this video (2)

### Day 17
    - Learned about LSA in NLP
    - Finished EDA for my textual dataset 
### Day 18
    - Learned about vectorization what itâ€™s, why we use it and to transform a code from for loops to vectorization for gradient descent and cost function calculations.
### Day 19
    - Continued on vectorization: vectorized the whole Gradient descent calculations process
    - Learned about Broadcasting in python, numpy library
    - Checked out more on medium articles on chatbot creation and searched for ways to do multi-class classification on NLP tasks

## Dependencies

To run these notebooks you'll need to install Python 3.6, PySyft, Numpy, PyTorch 1.0, and Jupyter Notebooks. The easiest way for all of this is to create a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n pysyft python=3.6
conda activate pysyft
conda install numpy jupyter notebook
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install syft
```
