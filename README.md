### Day 19
    - Continued on vectorization: vectorized the whole Gradient descent calculations process
    - Learned about Broadcasting in python, numpy library
    - Checked out more on medium articles on chatbot creation and searched for ways to do multi-class classification on NLP tasks
Multi-class classification for NLP:

      - I was asked to add an ML qwiklabs lab to hold a study jam.
      - I requested access to  ML Intro with the TensorFlow quest.
      - I did the lab: Creating an Object Detection Application Using TensorFlow 
[Creating an Object Detection Application Using TensorFlow](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1823?parent=catalog)

[Creating Models with Amazon SageMaker](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/3561?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A1%2C%22num_filters%22%3A0%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=3019353#)
### Day 31
     - Participated in the online Fairygodboss recruiting event, it was a refreshing and first time experience.
### Day 32
     - Tried the Multi-class classification tutorial with LSTM on the customer complaint dataset. To implement it using my own dataset.
[The tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-lstm-1590bee1bd17)
### Day 33
    - I trained the multi-classification LSTM model I tried yesterday on the Omdena challenge PTSD dataset, the results were quite weird so I am thinking about redefining the structure of the dataset. Any suggestions are welcome üôè 
    - I tried training the same data using a pre-trained BERT model and it gave pretty good results (thinking about understanding BERT more deeply)
    - I finished week 1 and started week 2 of the TensorFlow course from Coursera of Andrew NG, it's pretty smooth and quite beginner-friendly:

## Dependencies

To run these notebooks you'll need to install Python 3.6, PySyft, Numpy, PyTorch 1.0, and Jupyter Notebooks. The easiest way for all of this is to create a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n pysyft python=3.6
conda activate pysyft
conda install numpy jupyter notebook
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install syft
```
